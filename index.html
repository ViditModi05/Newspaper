                <p>CVoter predicts NDA vote share will rise from 45.1% in 2019 to 45.3% in 2024. 
                BJP alone is expected to poll a vote share of 38.9%, compared to 37.4% in 2019.
                As the long-drawn Lok Sabha elections end, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance 
                is predicted to win up to 383 seats, according to poll survey agency C-Voter. If the 
                predictions hold true on the results day on June 4, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will 
                be the only second Prime Minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms 
                to power in general elections Of the 543 Lok Sabha seats, the pollster has predicted NDA 
                winning between 353 to 383 seats. The opposition INDIA bloc may win anywhere between 152 
                to 182 seats, the surveyor said. The ruling alliance at the Centre is also tipped to see 
                a rise in its vote share from 45.1 per cent in 2019 to 45.3 per cent in 2024. 
                The BJP alone is expected to poll a vote share of 38.9 per cent, compared to 37.4 per cent in the 
                previous general election in 2019. The INDIA bloc, which comprises 28 opposition parties, including the 
                Congress to put up a fight against ruling NDA, may get a vote share of 39.9 per cent in the Lok Sabha election 2023, 
                according to the C Voter numbers</p>

                <h3>Editor's Coloumn</h3>
                <p>As India stands at the crossroads of economic transformation, it is imperative that our policies extend beyond mere GDP growth. 
                    The new government must ensure that the benefits of high growth trickle down to the lower income categories. While economic reforms
                    are crucial, we must also address pressing issues related to employment, consumption, and exports. <br />
                    <br />
                    Moreover, let us not forget our legacy‚Äîthe indomitable spirit of Mahatma Gandhi. His principles of non-violence, self-reliance, and 
                    social justice remain relevant today. As we embrace change, let us do so with compassion and inclusivity. <br />
                    <br />
                    Fossil fuels may dominate our energy landscape for decades, but our overriding priority should be to reduce their share. Sustainable alternatives, 
                    innovation, and environmental consciousness must guide our path forward. <br />
                    <br />
                    India deserves change, and disruption alone can bring it. Let us move beyond rhetoric and embark on a holistic journey towards progress‚Äîone that 
                    uplifts every citizen, regardless of their socio-economic background.üòäüì∞

                <p>Porsche crash case: Maharashtra CM has assured thorough probe, says deceased's MP-based 
                    father.In the latest development in the Pune Porsche crash case, Pune police have arrested the mother of 
                    the teen accused of running over two people while driving the luxury car. The mother swapped her blood sample 
                    in order to prove that her son wasn't drunk when the accident occurred, police said. Commissioner of Police Amitesh 
                    Kumar said the accident investigation has revealed that the minor's blood samples were replaced with those of his mother.
                    Two techies were killed on May 19 in Pune's Kalyani Nagar after a Porsche allegedly being driven by the drunk minor rammed 
                    into their two wheeler. While the 17-year-old minor has been sent to an observation home, his father and grandfather have been
                    arrested for allegedly kidnapping the family's driver and putting pressure on him to take the blame. The investigation revealed 
                    efforts by the influential family to cover up the crime. They first tried to convince their family driver to take the blame for 
                    the chilling crash in lieu of cash. When he denied, they kidnapped him and kept forcing him to confess.</p>
